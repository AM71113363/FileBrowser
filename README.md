# FileBrowser
-----

## What it is?<br>
It just a library to explore sdcard,and pick a folder,a file,a file with a certain extention.<br>
●install the apk or re-build a new one to test it.<br>

## Build.
●the source of lib is in the filebrowser folder<br>
●the source of the apk is in the main folder,<br>
I'm not creating a bunch of folders here,so read the package in java files and create the folders if you want to build it.<br>

# NOTE
the App doesn't check Storage Permissions,so check them first.
